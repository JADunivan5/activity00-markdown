# activity00-markdown

In this repository/directory you should see five items:

1. `README-img` - a folder containing images that I am embedding within this `README.md` file
2. `.gitignore` - you can ignore this file for the time being
3. `5333.jpg` - an image that you will embed within your recreated document
4. `README.md` - this document
5. `activity00.pdf` - a PDF document that you will be recreating using your markdown skills

We will get to these items in a bit.

## Task 1: Forking the Repository

For this activity, you will make your own copy of my `activity00-markdown` repository.

In this GitHub repo, click on the ![fork](README-img/fork-icon.png) **Fork** icon near the upper-right-hand corner.
You should be taken a copy of this repo that is in your GitHub account - your page title should be `username/activity00-markdown`, where `username` is replaced with your GitHub username.

Congratulations!
With your group for today, reflect on what this process was like compared to other methods you might have used for sharing documents with others.
What was easier?
What was more difficult?

## Task 2: View the PDF

Verify that you are in your GitHub repo (i.e., `username/activity00-markdown`).
Now, click on the `activity00.pdf` file to view it.
You might want to open this in a separate/new tab so that you can easily switch between this `README` file and the PDF document.

On a piece of scrape paper and with your group for today, specify the different ways this document has been formatted.
Your goal is going to be to recreate this document as a Markdown document (using the skills you experienced from the Markdown tutorial: https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/).
Remember there was a helpful cheatsheet here: https://commonmark.org/help/.

## Task 3: Re-creating the Document

Verify that you are in the root folder of your GitHub repo.
If you are reading these directions, you should be here.

1. Near the top of this page, click on **Add file** and then select "Create new file".
2. Name your file `firstname-document.md`, where you have replaced `firstname` with your first name.
3. Using your notes from Task 2 and your group members, recreate the `activity00.pdf`. You are aiming for 95% accuracy. You can preview your work by clicking on the **Preview** tab at the top of your Markdown file.
4. When you have finished, provide a **Commit Message**. Minimally, you should provide a brief description of what you did where it currently says "Create new file" in the **Commit new file** area at the bottom of the page. Then, click on the green button to commit your file.

In about 15 minutes, I will upload my solution document to my `activity00-markdown` repo.
I will then show you how to update your repo to also include this solution document.

If you run into issues, start with talking to your group members.
If as a group you cannot figure it out or you have differing ideas, call me over.
I will be circling through the groups to be seeing how you are progressing, but also to help put out any fires.

## What is next?

In **Activity 1**, we will get to know GitHub a little better.
We will also discuss your Major Project and Grades.
